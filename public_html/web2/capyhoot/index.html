    <h2>My capy Skill: hos.1.4 "Stay Focused and On Task"</h2>
    <p>What level am I: 4</p> 
    <p>Why I'm this level and how I aspire to be after this process + future in my level:</p>
    <p>I believe that I am level 4 because I always use reminders to make sure to stay focused and on task. Without those reminders I can get easily distracted, and at times give up on my work altogether. After this project I aspire to be an 8, but realistically a 6 would be nice too!</p>
    <p>Looking back at my work and the time I spent on it, I went up to a level 6. Being on time to group meetups and working actively with them helped me stay more focused. The environment was educational, peaceful, and inspiring thanks to my teammates. Most of the time, I didnt use rem8inders to stay on task. I did not think of many strategies, but one that I implemented was coming a bit earlier to meetups so I can get my mind focused on task beforehand and start working already.</p>

    <h3>How the process went</h3>
    <p>I think in general it went pretty smoothly, not too stressful or too big of a job. Our team discussions were respectful and helpful, and we discussed a lot. Everyone was ready to help and give feedback, which I appreciated. I worked on all of the questions, as well as the css for the page where the game-modes are listed.</p>
    <p>Achievements: Achievements that we had was our organization and communication in my opinion. Most of us were present at every meeting, and if not the teammate would let us know and ask what they missed. Everyone worked with their full potential and did a really good job!</p>
    <p>Problems: The problem that I encountered is not having much to do. This is honestly a dream problem, so I was okay with it, but at times I felt like I wasn't giving enough help. I asked my teammates if they needed help, but they said they were alright, and said that I did a lot of work. So maybe its just my anxiety!</p>
    <p>Resolvements: A way I resolved this problem is by trying to work on menial tasks that maybe some people weren't paying attention to. This could include little problems with the css, or stylistic changes.</p>

    <p>A: achievable - reasonable workload and jump in level</p>
    <p>R: relevant - relevant to my productivity and growth relating to my program as well as in life</p>
