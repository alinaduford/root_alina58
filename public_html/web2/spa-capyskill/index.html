    <h1>SPA Capyskill</h1>
    <p>my capyskill: Creating design projects VA.1.4</p>
    <p>what level am i and why i lelieve that: I believe when I started the project I was a level 6. In past projects I was able to apply design principles, relfect on my work, and receive feedback that would guide me. I did not have enough skill to ask and give feedbacks from others and engage in constructive critique.</p>
    <p>what level im at now: I think I jumped to a level 10 after the project. I used a lot of feedback from teachers and friends to improve my work, making my purpose more clear and reflective of my own personal style. What I think prevented me from a level 10 is not deepening my critique/analyze with my peers. </p>

        <h2>How the process went</h2>
        <p>in general: I think that the process of the project went really well. I had tried to be less scared of asking questions, and asking for critiques. I asked friends and peers what they thought of it, and got constructive feedback from them.</p>
        <p>achievements: My achievement was being able to be less scared of asking questions/critiques in class. I am a more quiet person usually so this was big for me. I researched for long to pick out a style most closely to my likes.</p>
        <p>problems: The problem I had was talking to peers. For me thats something i dont try to improve in.</p>
        <p>resolvements: I tried asking friends in my pogram what they thought of my work, which i never usually do. This helped me be less scared.</p>
